# Differentiate Penguin Species
In this project we are going to perform exploartory data analysis and ccreate machine learning models using following algorithms:
* Logistic regression
* SVM
* MLP
* RF
* Gradient Boosting

to predict the species of a given penguin. 

# Dataset

The Penguin dataset contains following attributes:
* species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
* culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
* culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
* flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
* body_mass_g: body mass (g)
* island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)
* sex: penguin sex

The target attribute: species

# Installation
To develop this project Jupyter Notebooks and Anaconda are used. You can install Anaconda from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).
Then either use Jupyter Labs or jupyter notebook extension to open the files. 
You can also view the project on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elmirao/predict-penguin-species)
